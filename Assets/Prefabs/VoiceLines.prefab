  - Congratulations! I was about to lose all my hope and just hand you the answer.
  - Finally... That almost took longer than my first  marriage. Congrats, I guess...
  - Good job people, took you long enough. Now grab that cube and MOVE ON!
  levelSolvedSubs:
  - 'Level complete! Onto another one then, heh. Thats not the end of the game, what
    did you think... '
  - 'Oh wow! You escaped, that was unexpected. Well not to worry, here is another
    level. '
  - YAY! Fiiiiinally, I thought you would never make it. Congraats..
  noPuzzleSolvedSubs:
  - Cmooon people, how long do I have to wait for something to happen. This is a
    puzzle game, you have to solve puzzles. Do THAT!
  - 'Hey guys, this is a puuuuzle game, how about we solve some puzzles ay. '
  - So uhm, if you are really stuck both of you can stand up for a little while and
    the game will reset.
  startVoiceLineSubs:
  - Oh look! New players.

  - "I know, I know, I know, I know\u2026 I-I I know. "
  - "I know you are already sitting, it\u2019s just an expression. "
  - "You are even more annoying than the last guys\u2026 Anyhow.."
  - 'Welcome! You are about to play a perspective puzzle game. '
  - 'Your goal is to work together, in order to solve all the puzzles and escape. '
  - "Now, just because you haven\u2019t seen, smelled, "
  - or touched a splitscreen game since 1997
  - "it doesn\u2019t mean anything about the quality of my game."
  - "Ok\u2026 Off you go!"
